# pt_app
Introduction
This is a Flask web application that allows users to register as either a client or a trainer. Clients will be able to book sessions with trainers while trainers can register their availability.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

Python 3.x
Flask
Flask-SQLAlchemy
Flask-Login
Flask-WTF
Bcrypt
Installation
To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/LiamCorness/pt_app.git

Navigate to the directory:
cd flask-app

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:
python pt_app.py


Still very much a work in progress.
